NetFPGA is a not-for-profit UK Community Interest Company (C.I.C.)
  supporting the community of academic, student, non-profit, industrial and hobbyist
  users of the open-source hardware-software designs such as the <a
  href="http://www.netfpga.org/">NetFPGA</a> programmable networking
platform.
  NetFPGA C.I.C. will act as a holder and licenser of open-source
  hardware-software designs, with a particular interest in research and
  teaching applications.

<h2>NetFPGA C.I.C. projects</h2>

<dt><a href="http://www.netfpga.org/">NetFPGA programmable networking
platform</a></dt>
<dd>The NetFPGA platform is a line-rate capable, flexible, and open
platform for research, and classroom experimentation. 
The NetFPGA platform was originally built 
to support teaching of a networking
class; since that time there have been several further designs intended to
update and extend the platform with increased speeds and updated
hardware.</dd>

<h2>NetFPGA license and agreements</h2>

<p>
The NetFPGA open-source hardware-software license extends the Apache Software
License with additional intellectual property types specific to hardware
designs &ndash; e.g., mask rights &ndash; in order to better support
open-source hardware.
It is our hope that organisations such as Apache may accept open-source
hardware as part of their remit in the future, both in terms of licenses and
willingness to host open-source hardware projects, in which case working with
an extended license might cease to be necessary.

<li><a href="legal/netfpga-hardware-software-license.txt">NetFPGA hardware-software
  license v1.0</a></li>

  agreement</a></li>
<li><a href="legal/netfpga-cla-corporate.txt">NetFPGA corporate contributor

</ul>

<p>
The NetFPGA open-source hardware-software license agreement is derived from the
  <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>'s <a
  href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache Software License
  2.0</a>, with minor modifications extending it to support additional
  intellectual property rights associated with hardware (e.g., mask rights).
  We have prepared a <a href="legal/diff.html">diff between the two
  open-source licenses</a> for interested parties to inspect.
  The Apache Software Foundation <a
  href="http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html">guidance on documenting
  copyright and license in source files</a> applies and will be used for all
  NetFPGA projects.
